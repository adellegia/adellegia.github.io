1. [Predicting Merger Decision Outcomes of the European Commission: A Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning approach](https://github.com/adellegia/predicting-merger-decision-outcomes) (October 2022 --- May 2023)
_Master Thesis, Hertie School_

    A novel application of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to predict merger decision outcomes of the European Commission by analyzing extracted text from official merger decisions. Identified a Support Vector Machine linear classifier as the best-performing model in predicting mergers that were either approved unconditionally or subject to conditions with an 84% recall and 63% precision.

2. [Analyzing the German Public Procurement Network: Implications for Corruption Risk](https://github.com/adellegia/network-analysis-EU-procurements) (April 2023 --- May 2023)
_A Research Project for Applied Network Analysis, Hertie School_

    Analysis of corruption risk using single-bidding rates in centralized German public contracts 2008-2016 by conducting network-based approaches such as R-A clustering, degree distributions, k-core decomposition, modularity maximization, and measurement of nodal centrality.

3. [Classification of Unstructured Documents: Transfer Learning with BERT](https://github.com/adellegia/watermelon) (November 2022 --- December 2022)
_A Tutorial Project for Deep Learning, Hertie School_

    A Python tutorial on building a text classification pipeline for unstructured documents using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The tutorial focuses on predicting stakeholder agreement with the EU's Digital Markets Act proposal using public consultation documents.

4. [Emotionality and Rationality in Speeches of EU Commissioners](https://github.com/adellegia/Emotionality-in-Political-Speech-of-the-EU-Commission) (November 2022)
_A Research Project for Text as Data , Hertie School_

    Investigated the variation in the use of reason and emotion in communicating politics of the European Commission across time and events using word2vec word embeddings and structural topic modeling.

5. [High Resolution Traffic Accident Prediction in Berlin](https://github.com/adellegia/Traffic-Accident-Prediction-Berlin) (February 2022 --- May 2022)
_A Research Project for Machine Learning, Hertie School_

    Investigated the variation in the use of reason and emotion in communicating politics of the European Commission across time and events using word2vec word embeddings and structural topic modeling.

6. [Spotify-MatchedR](https://adellegia.shinyapps.io/data-project-spotify-matchedr/) (November 2021 --- December 2021)
_A Research Project for Machine Learning, Hertie School_

    An R shiny app for measuring music taste compatibility of 5 users based on their 100 most listened songs 2018-2020 using Spotify's Web API. Musical metrics like danceability and popularity were visualized using plotly.

7. [GetHelp](https://github.com/adellegia/GetHelp) (September 2021 --- December 2021)
_A Project for Data Structures and Algorithms, Hertie School_

    AA Python-based app built using object-oriented programming to match requests (e.g., ride, tutor) of students of Hertie School.
