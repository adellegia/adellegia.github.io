[Predicting Merger Decision Outcomes of the European Commission: A Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning approach](https://github.com/adellegia/predicting-merger-decision-outcomes) (October 2022 --- May 2023)
_Master Thesis, Hertie School_

A novel application of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to predict merger decision outcomes of the European Commission by analyzing extracted text from official merger decisions. Identified a Support Vector Machine linear classifier as the best-performing model in predicting mergers that were either approved unconditionally or subject to conditions with an 84% recall and 63% precision.
