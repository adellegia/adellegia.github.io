- [Predicting Merger Decision Outcomes of the European Commission: A Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning approach](https://github.com/adellegia/predicting-merger-decision-outcomes) (October 2022 --- May 2023)
_Master Thesis, Hertie School_

A novel application of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to predict merger decision outcomes of the European Commission by analyzing extracted text from official merger decisions. Identified a Support Vector Machine linear classifier as the best-performing model in predicting mergers that were either approved unconditionally or subject to conditions with an 84% recall and 63% precision.

- [Analyzing the German Public Procurement Network: Implications for Corruption Risk](https://github.com/adellegia/network-analysis-EU-procurements) (April 2023 --- May 2023)
_A Research Project for Applied Network Analysis course, Hertie School (Grade: 1.30/95\%)_

Analyzed corruption risk using single-bidding rates in centralized German public contracts 2008-2016 by conducting network-based approaches such as R-A clustering, degree distributions, k-core decomposition, modularity maximization, and measurement of nodal centrality.
