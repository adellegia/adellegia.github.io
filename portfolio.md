\subsection{{\href{https://github.com/adellegia/predicting-merger-decision-outcomes}{Predicting Merger Decision Outcomes of the European Commission} \hfill October 2022 --- May 2023}}
\subtext{Master Thesis \hfill Hertie School}
\begin{zitemize}
\item A novel application of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to predict merger decision outcomes of the European Commission by analyzing extracted text from official merger decisions. Identified a Support Vector Machine linear classifier as the best-performing model in predicting mergers that were either approved unconditionally or subject to conditions with an 84\% recall and 63\% precision.

\subsection{{\href{https://github.com/adellegia/watermelon}{Analyzing the German Public Procurement Network: Implications for Corruption Risk} \hfill April 2023 --- May 2023}}
\subtext{A Research Project for Applied Network Analysis course (Grade: 1.30/95\%) \hfill Hertie School}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Analyzed corruption risk using single-bidding rates in centralized German public contracts 2008-2016 by conducting network-based approaches such as R-A clustering, degree distributions, k-core decomposition, modularity maximization, and measurement of nodal centrality.
\end{zitemize}

\subsection{{\href{https://github.com/adellegia/watermelon}{Classification of Unstructured Documents: Transfer Learning with BERT} \hfill November 2022 --- December 2022}}
\subtext{A Project for Deep Learning course (Grade: 1.70/86\%) \hfill Hertie School}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Created a Python tutorial on building a text classification pipeline for unstructured documents using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The tutorial focuses on predicting stakeholder agreement with the EU's Digital Markets Act proposal using public consultation documents.
\end{zitemize}

\subsection{{\href{https://github.com/adellegia/Emotionality-in-Political-Speech-of-the-EU-Commission}{Emotionality and Rationality in Speeches of EU Commissioners} \hfill November 2022}}
\subtext{A Research Project for Text as Data (Grade: 1.30/92\%) \hfill Hertie School}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Investigated the variation in the use of reason and emotion in communicating politics of the European Commission across time and events using word2vec word embeddings and structural topic modeling.
\end{zitemize}

\subsection{{\href{https://github.com/benediktstroebl/Machine-Learning-Project-Group-F}{High Resolution Traffic Accident Prediction in Berlin} \hfill February 2022 --- May 2022}}
\subtext{A Research Project for Machine Learning (Grade: 1.30/94\%) \hfill Hertie School}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Predicted the occurrence of accidents on a given road segment at a given date and hour in Berlin by training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Balanced Random Forest, Balanced Bagging, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost using data on road accident 2018-2020, road network, and historic weather.
\end{zitemize}

\subsection{{\href{https://adellegia.shinyapps.io/data-project-spotify-matchedr/}{Spotify-MatchedR} \hfill November 2021 --- December 2021}}
\subtext{A Project for Intro to Data Science (Grade: 1.30/92\%) \hfill Hertie School}
\begin{zitemize}
\item An \emph{R shiny} app for measuring music taste compatibility of 5 users based on their 100 most listened songs 2018-2020 using Spotify's Web API. Musical metrics like danceability and popularity were visualized using \emph{plotly}.
\end{zitemize}

\subsection{{\href{https://github.com/adellegia/GetHelp}{GetHelp} \hfill September 2021 --- December 2021}}
\subtext{A Project for Data Structures and Algorithms (Grade: 1.00/96\%) \hfill Hertie School}
\begin{zitemize}
\item A Python-based app built using object-oriented programming to match requests (e.g., ride, tutor) of students of Hertie School.
\end{zitemize}
