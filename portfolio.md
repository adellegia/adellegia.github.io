#### 1. Predicting Merger Decision Outcomes of the European Commission: A Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning approach
_Master Thesis, Hertie School_ (October 2022 --- May 2023) <br>
_Github repo:_ [predicting-merger-decision-outcomes](https://github.com/adellegia/predicting-merger-decision-outcomes)

A novel application of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to predict merger decision outcomes of the European Commission by analyzing extracted text from official merger decisions. Identified a Support Vector Machine linear classifier as the best-performing model in predicting mergers that were either approved unconditionally or subject to conditions with an 84% recall and 63% precision. _Read more on this_ [_post._](https://adellegia.github.io/2023-06-08-predicting-merger-decision-outcomes/) 

#### 2. Analyzing the German Public Procurement Network: Implications for Corruption Risk
_A Research Project for Applied Network Analysis, Hertie School_ (April 2023 --- May 2023) <br>
_Github repo:_ [network-analysis-EU-procurements](https://github.com/adellegia/network-analysis-EU-procurements)

Analysis of corruption risk using single-bidding rates in centralized German public contracts 2008-2016 by conducting network-based approaches such as R-A clustering, degree distributions, k-core decomposition, modularity maximization, and measurement of nodal centrality. _Read more on this_ [_post._](https://adellegia.github.io/2023-06-08-network-analysis-DE-procurements)

#### 3. Classification of Unstructured Documents: Transfer Learning with BERT
_A Tutorial Project for Deep Learning, Hertie School_ (November 2022 --- December 2022) <br>
_Github repo:_ [EU-DMA-Text-Classification-BERT](https://github.com/adellegia/watermelon)

A Python tutorial for building a text classification pipeline using unstructured documents with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The tutorial focuses on predicting stakeholder agreement with the EU's Digital Markets Act proposal using public consultation documents.

#### 4. Emotionality and Rationality in Speeches of EU Commissioners 
_A Research Project for Text as Data , Hertie School_ (November 2022) <br>
_Github repo:_ [Emotionality-in-Political-Speech-of-the-EU-Commission](https://github.com/adellegia/Emotionality-in-Political-Speech-of-the-EU-Commission)

Investigated the variation in the use of reason and emotion in communicating politics of the European Commission across time and events using word2vec word embeddings and structural topic modeling. 

#### 5. High Resolution Traffic Accident Prediction in Berlin
_A Research Project for Machine Learning, Hertie School_ (February 2022 --- May 2022) <br>
_Github repo:_ [Traffic-Accident-Prediction-Berlin](https://github.com/adellegia/Traffic-Accident-Prediction-Berlin) 

Predicted the occurrence of accidents on a given road segment at a given date and hour in Berlin by training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Balanced Random Forest, Balanced Bagging, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost using data on road accident 2018-2020, road network, and historic weather. 

#### 6. Spotify-MatchedR
_A Research Project for Machine Learning, Hertie School_ (November 2021 --- December 2021) <br>
_Github repo:_ [Spotify-MatchedR](https://github.com/adellegia/Spotify-MatchedR)

An R shiny app for measuring music taste compatibility of 5 users based on their 100 most listened songs 2018-2020 using Spotify's Web API. Musical metrics like danceability and popularity were visualized using plotly. _Try out the app here:_ [Spotify-MatchedR](https://adellegia.shinyapps.io/data-project-spotify-matchedr/). 

#### 7. GetHelp
_A Project for Data Structures and Algorithms, Hertie School_ (September 2021 --- December 2021) <br>
_Github repo:_ [GetHelp](https://github.com/adellegia/GetHelp) 

A Python-based app built using object-oriented programming to match requests (e.g., ride, tutor) of students of Hertie School.
