Hi! I'm Adelle Arbo.

### My story

I'm from the tropical country of the Philippines. I moved to Berlin in 2021 to study and I have recently finished Master of Data Science for Public Policy from the Hertie School, with a focus on the application of data science in competition economics and sustainable development. 

I'm a trained statistician who completed her Bachelor of Science in Statistics (cum laude) from the University of the Philippines Diliman. I have worked in the development sector with the Philippine Competition Commission and Asian Development Bank to aid in policymaking in antitrust, urbanization, and transport. During my studies at the Hertie School, I contributed to developing an R package for causal modeling at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center. Now, I am a Data Scientist at Compass Lexecon assisting private clients and regulatory bodies in antitrust decision-making.
