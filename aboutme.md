Hello there! My name is Adelle Arbo. Originally from the tropical country of the Philippines, I made the exciting decision to relocate to the vibrant city of Berlin.

I recently finished Master of Data Science for Public Policy from the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, with a focus on the application of data science in competition economics and sustainable development. I'm a trained statistician who completed her Bachelor of Science in Statistics (cum laude) from the University of the Philippines Diliman. I have worked in the development sector with the Philippine Competition Commission and Asian Development Bank to aid in policymaking in antitrust, urbanization, and transport. During my studies at the Hertie School, I contributed to developing an R package for causal modeling at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center. Now, I am a Data Scientist at Compass Lexecon assisting private clients and regulatory bodies in antitrust decision-making.
