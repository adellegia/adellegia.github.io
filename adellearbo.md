Hello! It's me, Adelle, originally from the sunny Philippines and now happily based in Berlin.

I’m a data scientist passionate about using data to shape smarter public policy and support sustainable development. I hold a Master’s in Data Science for Public Policy from the Hertie School, and I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from the University of the Philippines Diliman.

Before moving to Berlin, I worked on policymaking in antitrust, urbanization, and transport at the Philippine Competition Commission and the Asian Development Bank. Now, as a Data Scientist at Compass Lexecon, I help clients and regulatory bodies make data-driven decisions in antitrust and economic analysis.
